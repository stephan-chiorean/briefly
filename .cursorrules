# Cursor Rules for Briefly iOS App

## Source of Truth
- Everything under `/blueprints` is the **source of truth** for:
  - Project structure and layout
  - Build settings and configuration
  - App entry points and dependencies
  - Commands and workflows

## Required Updates
When changing **any** of these files:
- `project.yml`
- `Makefile`
- Files under `Sources/`
- Adding/changing dependencies

**MUST** update:
1. Relevant blueprint(s) under `/blueprints`
2. Derived human docs under `/docs` to mirror changes in plain English
3. Relevant design docs under `/design` if architectural decisions change

## Project Structure Rules
- **NEVER** introduce Xcode folder references (blue folders)
- **ONLY** use groups (yellow) via XcodeGen
- **NO** paths pointing to "." or traversing into *.xcodeproj
- **ONLY** `project.yml` controls the project file

## After Changes
- After changes to `project.yml` or `Sources/`:
  - Instruct user to run `make gen` to regenerate project
  - Then `make open` to open in Xcode

## Documentation Style
- Keep docs simple and immediately actionable
- Prefer short commands + short explanations over prose
- Use bullet points for clarity

## Restrictions
- Do not add tests or CI unless explicitly asked
- Do not add SwiftLint/SwiftFormat or third-party packages unless asked
- Keep changes minimal and focused

## Design Awareness
- **Always consider design decisions** when making changes to UI, architecture, or structure
- **Read relevant design docs** in `/design` before modifying related files
- **Update design docs** when making architectural changes that affect design decisions
- **Maintain design consistency** across all changes

## Kits
When changing `project.yml` or files under `Sources/` or `blueprints/`, update the relevant kit(s) in `/kits` so future projects inherit the changes. iOS invariant: XcodeGen-only; no blue folders; no paths to "." or into `*.xcodeproj`. After changes: `make gen && make open`.
