# Design

**Design decisions and architectural choices** for this iOS project.

## What Is This Directory?

This directory contains **design documentation** that explains the reasoning behind architectural and implementation decisions. It's separate from technical implementation (blueprints) and user guides (docs).

## Directory Structure

- **`UI/`** - User interface design decisions and structure
- **`backend/`** - Backend architecture and API design decisions  
- **`auth/`** - Authentication and security design decisions

## Purpose

- **Document decisions**: Why we chose specific approaches
- **Guide future development**: Help maintain consistency
- **Onboard new developers**: Explain the reasoning behind the architecture
- **Reference for changes**: Understand impact of modifications

## Relationship to Other Docs

- **Design** → **Blueprints** (`/blueprints`): Design decisions inform technical implementation
- **Design** → **Docs** (`/docs`): Design decisions may influence user-facing documentation
- **Design** → **Kits** (`/kits`): Design decisions are embedded in the project templates

## Maintenance

When making significant architectural changes:
1. Update relevant design documentation
2. Ensure design decisions are still valid
3. Update related blueprints and docs if needed
